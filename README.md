Hi.
You need to read this so R E A D
ok, welcome to my project named HWAL (Homelabing Web App Language)
the code was made by AI copilot but... Dont hate me, I dont have enough python skills to do that.
ok now what you need:
1.python 10.0+ (i use 13.0)
2.python flask (when you downloaded python on your system heres the flask install command: pip install flask)
3.notepad or a text editor that can not only save as txt. (VScode recomended)
ok one more thing - To make  it work:
1.You can only have ONE .hwal file, why? the app.py will be confused which to take and to not.
2.if you want to put any media (mp4,mp3) you need to put it inside the folder named load.hwal (the same folder as your script)
3.after you put your script and media (if mentioned in script) you must run app.py, it will give you the link to a website (your localhost. dont worry, its not a important thing) where it will load your hwal script as a html website! (bonus. if you want to get the normal html code just right click and selct option ,,see source code" or something, and you'l have the html script that you can copy and paste!)




and yes you can edit the app.py and add new commands if you know python, i want people create mods and share tchem how far they can ;)
